# HTTP Server in C++
- This is my attempt at creating an HTTP server from scratch using TCP sockets.
- I learnt how to set up sockets for the server to bind and listen to by reading "Beej's Guide to Network Programming", a lightweight book on how to use set up and use sockets.
- **Works only on UNIX-based operating systems**

- As of 18/09/2025, you can create URL handlers and hook them up to the Router to serve get requests that return HTML, raw text, or whatever. Will begin to work on handling POST requests.
